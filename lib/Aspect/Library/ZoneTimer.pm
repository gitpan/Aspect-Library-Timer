=head1 NAME

Aspect::Library::ZoneTimer - Generate named time cost breakdowns

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Aspect;
  use Aspect::Library::ZoneTimer;
  
  aspect ZoneTimer => (
      zones => {
          main     => call 'MyProgram::main',
          parsing  => call 'PPI::Document::new',
          database => call qr/^DB[DI]::.*?\b(?:prepare|execute|fetch.*)$/,
      },
      handler => sub {
          # Print the results, or send to syslog
      }
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

While a full profiler like L<Devel::NYTProf> is great for development and
analysis, it is generally far too slow and generates too much data to run
it on a production machine.

B<Aspect::Library::ZoneTimer> is designed to provide some of the same
benefits of a regular profiler, but in a way that can be deployed onto
one or many production servers.

The B<ZoneTimer> aspect lets you break up your program into a series of
named "zones" based on the areas in which you expect your program will
expend the most wallclock time.

In the example above, we expect that most of the program time will be spent
either parsing Perl files using L<PPI> (which we know to be slow) or
waiting for a response from our database of some kind. We also define a top
zone that we expect to enter as soon as the program starts to do useful
work.

Each zone is defined by a L<Aspect::Pointcut|pointcut> that identifies the
key functions that serve as entry points for that area of the program.

As your program executes, the B<ZoneTimer> will watch at these zone entry
points, and track the progress of your program as it moves between the
different zones.

The wallclock time for the execution is tallied up both inclusive and
exclusive for each zone, and when the top-most zone exits the results are
handed off to a handler callback so you can write the times to disk,
save them to a database, or send them to a local or remote syslog.
